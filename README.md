# Alpha_Lantern
**Putting the pieces together.**

Here we are assembling the components for a basic web implementation of the LSTM Lantern application.

**Folders:**

***Web-Model-DB DEMO***: Implementation of a basic front end that collects input features (id, location, behavior description), uses the ML model to classify according to violence types, and return the classifications along with the input data to the front end and to the database.

***MS Meeting Prep DEMO***: Implementation of a more attractive front end with a pseudo-chat-bot interface that collects behavior inputs, uses the ML model to calculate strengths of violence type association, and returns the values to a dynamic histogram that responds to successive user inputs.

***NOTE:*** Both DEMOs are built on the same basic flask-sqlalchemy backbone.
