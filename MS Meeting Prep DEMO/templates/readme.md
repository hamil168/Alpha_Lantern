## RESTful Model API Demo
### HTML Templates

**NOTE:** The meeting prep demo app.py is able to use these templates, however, the "demonstration" front end that runs out of index.html does not require them.

**Contents:**
- new.html: fields for new student submission to the API
- show_all.html: database info for all students
